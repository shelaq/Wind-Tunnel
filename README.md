## Synopsis

The task for our AP Physics summative project was to build a wind tunnel, 
with mechanisms to measure the drag and lift on an airfoil, as well as a method 
to measure and display the windspeed in the tunnel in real-time.
Included here is the code for the GUI and the connection to the hardware components. 
Java, along with Arduino and Ardulink are used.

##GUI
->Width and weight of airfoil in the tunnel  
->Drag and lift in Newtons  
->Real and equivalent wind speeds  
->Graph to measure wind speed and force over a set time interval  
->Arrows on airfoil image grow and shrink in response to the change in force on the airfoil

##Airfoil Templates
For 3D printing. 4 different types of airfoils are used, with differing amounts of camber, as well as a
propellor which was included as part of a "bonus" for the project.
